Dependencies :

express (Node) -> Server Side
pjs -> Template View ( check when it is used)
survey-react -> Create the Survey
socket.io -> page listener to server
nodemon -> allows not to restart the server when a page is saved - not necessary in production
    (check "https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/" to make it work)
